				<h2>LASH EXTENSIONS</h2>
			  	<p class="page-text">
				  Please do not tint or perm your eyelash extensions after application and refrain from picking, pulling or rubbing. 
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   To ensure longevity, avoid eye drops unless necessary, where proper precautions should be taken with extreme care to avoid moisture coming in contact with your eyelash extensions.
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   Avoid steam and humidity (i.e. showers or saunas) for 24 hours after application. Avoid excessive heat in close contact with your lashes as they may affect retention, as well as curl, and possibly singe your lashes. For my 4/20 babes, please be cautious.
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   Wash your lashes at least 3x weekly. 
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   Avoid any products containing oils around your eyes after the application of your lashes. 
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   <em>AND PLEASE, NO MASCARA.</em>
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   Salt water will affect retention so plan your fills accordingly.
				   <h2>LASH LIFTS</h2>
				   <p class="page-text">
					 Keep your lashes dry for 24 hours after receiving a lash lift.
					 <br />
					 <br />
					 If dryness occurs, apply a vitamin E oil.
				   </p>
				   <h2>BROW LAMINATION</h2>
				   <p class="page-text">
				   Please wait 6 to 8 weeks between getting brow laminations. 
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   If pregnant or breastfeeding, please consult a physician before before receiving a brow lamination.
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   Keep your brows dry for 24 hours after receiving a brow lamination.
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   If dryness occurs, apply a vitamin E oil.
				   </p>
				   <h2>TOOTH GEMS</h2>
				   <p class="page-text">
					Tooth gems last 6 months to a year with proper care. Ensure to brush your teeth as normal and to remain aware not to eat any excessively hard foods, especially in the first 24 hours, or avoid chewing with the side you have had gems applied.   
					<br />
					<br />
					 We recommend making an appointment with your dentist to properly remove the gem. If you need to remove
					 the gem at home, it can be removed with traditional tweezers or dental floss. Pry up on any side of the gem
					 to remove; floss can work with a little more pressure, moving back and forth to "cut" the glue.
					 <br />
					 <br />
					 <em>Make sure you have clean/brushed teeth prior to your appointment.</em> You should wait 12-24 hours after
					 gem application to avoid sensitivity or premature loss of your gem. Brushing too soon after your treatment
					 will be abrasive on teeth and gums. If sensitivity occurs, it will diminish within 24 hours.
					 <br />
